What?
===========
fpaste is command-line frontend for the Fedora Pastebin service at fpaste.org.
It allows easy uploading of multiple files, or of copy&pasted text from stdin,
without requiring a web browser. A unique fpaste link is returned, which can
then be given to others who are offering help.

e.g.:
[joeuser@localhost ~]$ fpaste /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Uploading...

Why?
====
1) PRIMARY: users don't like being flooded with large amounts of text, and
   encourage the use of pastebin sites & utilities instead.
2) A GUI browser like firefox might be inaccessible.
3) A TUI browser like lynx might be too cumbersome.
4) Multiple files can be fpasted.
5) It's often faster & more convenient to use the cli than to copy/paste in a
   browser's textarea.
6) Why not?

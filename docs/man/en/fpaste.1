.SH "NAME"
fpaste \- A cli frontend for the fpaste.org pastebin
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBfpaste\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
It is often useful to be able to easily paste text to the Fedora Pastebin at http://fpaste.org and this simple utility will do that and return the resulting URL so that people may examine the output. This can hopefully help folks who are for some reason stuck without a graphical interface, working remotely, or any other reason they may be unable to paste something into the pastebin using a web browser.

To \fImanually paste clipboard\fR contents, run \fBfpaste\fR without file arguments so that it waits for input, then paste using mouse middle\-click, <Ctrl\-V>, or other, then press <Enter> followed by <Ctrl\-D> to finish (EOF).

To paste the output of more than one program and/or file at a time, use the following example forms:
.IP 
\fB(lsusb ; lspci) | fpaste\fR
.br 
\fBfpaste <(lsusb) <(lspci)\fR
.br 

\fBfpaste <(fdisk \-l) /etc/grub.conf \fR
.br 
\fB(fdisk \-l ; cat /etc/grub.conf) | fpaste \fR
.br 

\fB(uname \-a ; yum repolist) | fpaste\fR
.TP 
Gather and paste various information about the running system. The info collected should be practically anonymous, and you may use the \-\-printonly or \-\-confirm options to preview what would be sent. fpaste.org URLs are also practically anonymous ([a\-zA\-Z0\-9]**4 == 14,776,336 combinations), so you may also preview it instead before giving the link out.
